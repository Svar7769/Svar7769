Hello, I'm Svar 👋
I'm a Computer Science graduate student at UMass Lowell, driven by a passion for building intelligent systems and solving complex problems. My journey is fueled by curiosity across diverse domains, allowing me to explore a broad spectrum of technologies while delving deeply into select areas of expertise. 🛠️
💼 What I've been building and exploring:
Deep & Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning:
Designed and implemented advanced DRL algorithms (PPO, A2C, Hierarchical RL) for diverse environments, including multi-agent coordination (e.g., StarCraft II, VMAS Football), continuous control (LunarLander, MountainCar), and strategic game AI (Chess).
Applied PPO for dynamic inventory management, demonstrating real-world optimization capabilities.
Natural Language Processing & Generative AI:
Developed NLP applications leveraging Transformer models and Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic understanding, including context-aware movie recommendation systems and intelligent comment classification from social media data.
Computer Vision & Advanced Deep Learning Architectures:
Explored and implemented cutting-edge Deep Learning architectures, such as Visual Transformers for image understanding, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for super-resolution imaging, and CNNs for real-time ASL classification.
Robotics & Control Systems:
Engineered robotic control systems and motion planning algorithms, including real-time interfaces for TurtleBot 4 (ROS2/PyQt) and specialized kinematic path planning for custom robotic platforms with failsafe mechanisms.
Data-Driven Health Applications & System Internals:
Built data-driven applications for health tech (e.g., Android app using wearable data for opioid detection) and delved into low-level systems programming through custom operating system kernel development.
💡 Technologies & Concepts I'm passionate about:
Languages: Python, Java, C/C++, SQL, JavaScript
Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Flask, React, Node.js, OpenAI Gym, PySC2, SMACv2
Tools: Git, Docker, AWS, Android Studio, VS Code, Postman
Concepts: Machine Learning, Deep Learning (Reinforcement Learning, Multi-Agent RL, Transformers, GANs, CNNs), Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, UI/UX Design, Distributed Systems, Robotics (ROS2), Operating Systems
🧠 I thrive on problems that...
Bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and real-world societal impact (particularly in health and robotics).
Demand a blend of analytical rigor and creative problem-solving.
Present a steep learning curve and push the boundaries of my current knowledge.
