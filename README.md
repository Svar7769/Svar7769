# **Hey, I’m Svar 👋**

I'm a Computer Science grad student at **UMass Lowell** who loves building things — from smart recommendation systems to robot control interfaces. I'm that curious engineer who enjoys being a *jack of all trades and master of a chosen few* 🛠️

### **💼 What I’ve been up to lately:**

* **Deep & Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning:** Designed and implemented advanced DRL algorithms (PPO, A2C, Hierarchical RL) for diverse environments, including multi-agent coordination (e.g., StarCraft II, VMAS Football), continuous control, and strategic game AI (Chess).  
* **Natural Language Processing & Generative AI:** Developed NLP applications leveraging Transformer models and Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic understanding, including context-aware movie recommendation systems and intelligent comment classification.  
* **Computer Vision & Advanced Deep Learning:** Explored and implemented cutting-edge architectures like Visual Transformers for image understanding, GANs for super-resolution, and CNNs for real-time ASL classification.  
* **Robotics & Control Systems:** Engineered real-time control interfaces for TurtleBot 4 using ROS2 \+ PyQt and developed specialized kinematic path planning for custom robotic platforms with failsafe mechanisms.  
* **Data-Driven Health Tech:** Created an Android app using wearable data (Empatica E4) to detect opioid usage.  
* **Operating Systems Internals:** Gained a deeper understanding of system architecture by building a custom Xinu kernel from scratch.

### **💡 Tech I’m into:**

* **Languages:** Python, Java, C/C++, SQL, JavaScript  
* **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Flask, React, Node.js, OpenAI Gym, PySC2, SMACv2  
* **Tools:** Git, Docker, AWS, Android Studio, VS Code, Postman  
* **Concepts:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning (Reinforcement Learning, Multi-Agent RL, Transformers, GANs, CNNs), Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, UI/UX Design, Distributed Systems, Robotics (ROS2), Operating Systems

### **🧠 I like solving problems where...**

* Tech meets real-world impact (especially in health & robotics)  
* There's room to mix creativity with code  
* I can learn something new and slightly terrifying 😄

### **⚡ Fun Fact**

If my code doesn’t work, it’s probably because I updating something.
