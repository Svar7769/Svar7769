Hello, I'm Svar üëãI'm a Computer Science graduate student at UMass Lowell, driven by a passion for building intelligent systems and solving complex problems. My journey is fueled by curiosity across diverse domains, allowing me to explore a broad spectrum of technologies while delving deeply into select areas of expertise. üõ†Ô∏èüíº What I've been building and exploring:Deep &amp; Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning:Designed and implemented advanced DRL algorithms (PPO, A2C, Hierarchical RL) for diverse environments, including multi-agent coordination (e.g., StarCraft II, VMAS Football), continuous control (LunarLander, MountainCar), and strategic game AI (Chess).Applied PPO for dynamic inventory management, demonstrating real-world optimization capabilities.Natural Language Processing &amp; Generative AI:Developed NLP applications leveraging Transformer models and Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic understanding, including context-aware movie recommendation systems and intelligent comment classification from social media data.Computer Vision &amp; Advanced Deep Learning Architectures:Explored and implemented cutting-edge Deep Learning architectures, such as Visual Transformers for image understanding, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for super-resolution imaging, and CNNs for real-time ASL classification.Robotics &amp; Control Systems:Engineered robotic control systems and motion planning algorithms, including real-time interfaces for TurtleBot 4 (ROS2/PyQt) and specialized kinematic path planning for custom robotic platforms with failsafe mechanisms.Data-Driven Health Applications &amp; System Internals:Built data-driven applications for health tech (e.g., Android app using wearable data for opioid detection) and delved into low-level systems programming through custom operating system kernel development.üí° Technologies &amp; Concepts I'm passionate about:Languages: Python, Java, C/C++, SQL, JavaScriptFrameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Flask, React, Node.js, OpenAI Gym, PySC2, SMACv2Tools: Git, Docker, AWS, Android Studio, VS Code, PostmanConcepts: Machine Learning, Deep Learning (Reinforcement Learning, Multi-Agent RL, Transformers, GANs, CNNs), Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, UI/UX Design, Distributed Systems, Robotics (ROS2), Operating Systemsüß† I thrive on problems that...Bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and real-world societal impact (particularly in health and robotics).Demand a blend of analytical rigor and creative problem-solving.Present a steep learning curve and push the boundaries of my current knowledge.üì´ Let's connect!üßë‚Äçüíº LinkedInüß† Explore my projects‚úâÔ∏è Email me at: svarrajankumar_patel@student.uml.edu‚ö° Fun FactWhen I'm not coding, you can usually find me dissecting the latest research papers or trying to teach my smart home devices to make me coffee.
